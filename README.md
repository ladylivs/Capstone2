# CapstoneFinal

<h1>Ogma Blogs</h1>

<p>This was my capstone project for SCF Coding Academy's software developement bootcamp. We had to use all of our previously gained knowledge to create this capstone, exemplifiying our PERN stack capabilities: PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, and Node.js.</p>

<p>Since we were to do CRUD operations, I wanted to create a blog website, and I even did a mild amount of branding: Ogma Blogs, named after the ancient Celtic god of eloquence and writing. You can create a user, login, create posts, edit or delete those posts, and read everyone's blogs. We had less time than previous cohorts to complete this project, so my goal was MVP and some CSS so it would look nice -- and by the technology gods (or Ogma), I made it!</p>

<p>She's a simple website *slaps the hood* but by golly, she's more than I could have imagined making six months ago. </p>

<p>That being said, there is so much more I want to do to this React site. More CSS designing, profile pages, editing accounts, and I used a very simple verification process and I would like to improve it.</p>
